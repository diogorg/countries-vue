# INTRODUTION
- Hi, my name is Diogo and I made this application just to learn and have fun with vue js
# FEATURES
- Docker
    - Isolate node version
    - Keep all make commands to containers
- Husky
    - ESLint and commit message standard check
- Vue / Vuex
- Node 18
- Quasar
    - Just to get start with a new UI
- Axios
    - To request REST Countries API
- Nodemon
- Sass
- Local Storage
    - Good to avoid calling API all the time
# TODO LIST
1. Add jest tests
    - Sorry, my fault
2. CI/CD for tests and coverage
3. Change vuex to use real models, adapters and interfaces
    - Get a little close to a SOLID in front-end
4. Rebuild with Typescript
    - I like Typescript.
